Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.
<?php
	class Fruit{
		public $name;
		public $color;
		public function __construct($na,$co){
			$this->name=$na;
			$this->color=$co;
		}
		public function get_name(){
			
			 $this->color;
			  $this->name;

		}
		public function intro(){
			echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is{$this->color}.";
		}
	}
	$obj=new Fruit("Banana","Yellow");
	echo $obj->color;
	echo $obj->name;
	?>

<?php
class Frui {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color; 
  }
  protected function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}."; 
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Frui{
  public function message() {
    echo "Am I a fruit or a berry? "; 
  }
}

// Try to call all three methods from outside class
$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red");  // OK. __construct() is public
$strawberry->message(); // OK. message() is public
$strawberry->intro(); // ERROR. intro() is protected
?>
PHP - Overriding Inherited Methods
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public $weight;
  public function __construct($name, $color, $weight) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
    $this->weight = $weight;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}, the color is {$this->color}, and the weight is {$this->weight} gram.";
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red", 50);
$strawberry->intro();
?>
The final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.
<?php
class Fruit {
  final public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  // will result in error
  public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}
?>
